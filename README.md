# Music-Genre-Classification-Models

## Problem Statement
Due to the vast availability of information, large amounts of music data can be found without proper classification . Music classification allows us to understand patterns in peopleâ€™s music interests and identify creations that most satisfy individual artistic tastes. This project aims to categorize music sample data into 10 genres: blues, classical, country, jazz, pop, disco, hip-hop, metal, rock, and reggae.

## Dataset
GTZAN Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?select=Data 
Contains 100 30-second audio samples for 10 different genres of music 

## Algorithms
CNN Model: 71% Accuracy
RNN-LSTM Model: 71% Accuracy
Simple DNN Model: 87% Accuracy

## Lessons Learned
- Learned how to leverage the Librosa package to visualize audio data (create spectrograms, wave plots, and chroma grams)
- Learned importance of building various different types of models (DNN, CNN, RNN) to test which gives the best accuracy
- Learned how to better understand Python documentation
- Developed a greater understanding of the various aspects of audio data and the preprocessing of audio data
